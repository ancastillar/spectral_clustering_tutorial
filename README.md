# spectral_clustering_tutorial

In this repository, you will find two files that will help you understand the Spectral Clustering algorithm:

Implementation code:
This file contains an example using a synthetic dataset that is not easily clusterable with methods like k-means. It walks through the step-by-step implementation of the algorithm, which is based on the normalized graph Laplacian.

Theoretical explanation:
This document provides a detailed description of the algorithm, along with a step-by-step analysis of how it works and how the code is implemented.
